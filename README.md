## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

hi, this is giordan escalona welcome to my page.

I like listening to nujabes.

Please note that this isn't my only github account, so projects on here are ones I'm comfortable with associating with my public identity. Most of my work is hosted on another account that mainly deals with graphics, assembly-->C decompilation, and networking. 

This account is for AI, web development things, and other things I'm currently learning.

Feel free to contact me at: giordane02@gmail.com
I welcome any, especially if we have worked together before (I have **very** good memory).

On my free time, I play competitive video games (top ~100 peak on a well known auto battler).
